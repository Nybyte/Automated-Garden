Hello Folks

This project came for me personalli because everytime that I try to take after plants they always get burned or they runned out of water :)
So I want to automatized this action, even thought it could be upgraded to vegetables and fruits and I would like to have reports. I´ll try to make 24h Automatizated project so for protect the electronic we would need to print the case in PLA, Althought you can use other materials like PETG.

Then let´s pass to what we are gonna use:

(1-unit)-ESP32. 
(4-unit)-LEDS.
(1-unit)-Battery/Maybe Convert to AC/DC.
(1-unit)-Cammera. 
(1-unit)-Router-Wifi
(1-unit)-PLA.
(1-unit)-Solar Sensor.
(1-unit)-Humidity Sensor.
(1-unit)-Sim module.
(1-unit)-Relay
(1-unit)-DC Motor

Maybe this list will be update few times. but that´s the core of the electronics, However we need a 3D printer for make the case for the electronics.


Note: Also in this project you will find all necesary data for do the project and the prints.
